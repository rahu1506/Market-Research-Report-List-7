<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Micro X-ray Fluorescence Analyzer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact type X-ray Fluorescence Analyzer</li><li>Non-Contact X-ray Fluorescence Analyzer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Micro X-ray Fluorescence Analyzer market is segmented into two main types: contact and non-contact analyzers. Contact type X-ray fluorescence analyzers require direct physical contact with the sample for accurate measurements, making them ideal for solid materials and providing high-resolution data. In contrast, non-contact X-ray fluorescence analyzers use a remote approach, allowing for the analysis of samples without physical interaction. This method is suitable for delicate or valuable items, reducing the risk of damage while still delivering precise elemental analysis.</p></p>
