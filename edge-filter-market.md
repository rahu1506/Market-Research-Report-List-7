<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Edge Filter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Long Pass Wave</li><li>Short Pass Wave</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Edge filters are optical devices that selectively transmit certain wavelengths of light while blocking others. The Long Pass Filter (LPF) allows wavelengths longer than a specified cutoff to pass through, effectively filtering out shorter wavelengths. Conversely, the Short Pass Filter (SPF) transmits wavelengths shorter than a cutoff, blocking longer wavelengths. These filters are widely used in various applications, including photography, spectroscopy, and optical communications, to enhance image quality or isolate specific wavelengths for analysis or measurement.</p></p>
